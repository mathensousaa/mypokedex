# My Pokédex

# **My Pokédex**

My Pokédex is a simple Javascript website repository developed by me during the Web Development course at IFSP. The site aims to display several Pokémons requested from the Pokémon API repository (PokeAPI).

## **Features**

- Search Pokémon by number
- Display Pokémon image
- Responsive design

## **Technologies Used**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my-pokedex.git
```

1. Open **`index.html`** in your web browser

## **Usage**

1. Enter a Pokémon number in the search bar and click the search button.
2. The page will display the Pokémon with the matching numbers.

## **Future Additions**

I plan to add more features in the future, such as displaying detailed information about each Pokémon using the PokeAPI. This will allow users to view more information about each Pokémon, including their abilities, type, weight, height, and more.
